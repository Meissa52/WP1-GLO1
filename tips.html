    	<p>Due to the fact that these events do take place on or within the vicinity of a collage campus, us faculty at Alfred State College hope that you stay safe during these times. Here are some tips to help you and others stay safe: </p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>
    			<h3><b>Self Safety</b></h3>
    			<ul>
    				<li>
    					<h5>Dont drink too much</h5>
    					<p>This is an obvious one. On college campuses trying to stop underage drinking is like exterminating cockroaches on planet Earth. Impossible. Limit your drinking and alternate between alcohol and water to stay hydrated. Eat a complete meal before you begin drinking.</p>
    				</li>

    				<li>
    					<h5>Keep track of your drink</h5>
    					<p>Try not to let your drink leave your sight as this allows potential attackers an opening to administer date-rape drugs without your knowledge or pouring you more alcohol. Do not take drinks from strangers!</p>
    				</li>

    				<li>
    					<h5>Be prepared for anything</h5>
    					<p>Keep your phone and some extra cash on you at all times during events. These can get you out of most sticky situations. Also, make sure your phone is charged before going out.</p>
    				</li>
    			</ul>
    		</li>

    		<li>
    			<h3><b>Others Safety</b></h3>
    			<ul>
    				<li>
    					<h5>Talk about expectations</h5>
    					<p>Before going out talk with friends about what they expect to happen before the night ends. One of your friends may plan to spend time with the opposite sex while another just wants to party. If a friend is in a situation they did not talk with you about you could always step in.</p>
    				</li>

    				<li>
    					<h5>Check in on friends</h5>
    					<p>Its a good idea to check in with eachother every 30 minutes to an hour just to make sure everyone is save and not in a bad situation.</p>
    				</li>

    				<li>
    					<h5>Have a meeting spot</h5>
    					<p>Just in case someonee gets lost or something unexpected, have a spot that you all know to meet up at at the end of the event.</p>
    				</li>
    			</ul>
    		</li>

    		<li>
    			<h3><b>Who to call in an emergency</b></h3>
    			<ul>
    				<li>
    					<h5>University Police</h5>
    					<p>607-587-3999</p>
    				</li>

    				<li>
    					<h5>UAllegany County 911 Center</h5>
    					<p>911</p>
    				</li>
    			</ul>
